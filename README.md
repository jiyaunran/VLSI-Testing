# VLSI Testing

This repository contains coursework from the **VLSI Testing** class at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University** (Fall 2023).  
The assignments primarily focus on revising existing projects that involve:

- Logic simulation  
- Fault simulation (stuck-at and transition faults)  
- ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation) for both stuck-at and transition faults
